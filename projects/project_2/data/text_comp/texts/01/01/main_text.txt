Humble and Grumble were identical twins,
And Humble was ever so meek;
Grumble did nothing but grumble all day,
Some may even call him a freak.

Humble was happy and everyone’s friend,
Grumble was jealous of course;
Humble was happy to follow the Lord,
But Grumble, an immoral source.

Humble was never seen wearing a frown,
And Grumble, ne’er seen with a smile;
Humble won friends by just being himself,
But, Grumble, he won them by guile.

So Grumble, please follow Humble, your twin,
And Humble, don’t grumble, I pray,
For grumble will make you like Grumble, your twin,
