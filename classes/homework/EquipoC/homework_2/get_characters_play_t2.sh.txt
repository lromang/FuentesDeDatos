# Get the top N (default 10) characters
# in Macbeth.
# Why it is necessary to sort twice?
#	Because the sortings are different:
#	sort is default, sort -nr is to sort in 
#	numerical reverse order. Also, between the
#	two sorts, uniq -c also afects the output.
# What does 'uniq -c' do?
#	Counts how many times an expression is repeated
# Relace the regex with: '\w+'. Explain.
#	This would match any word char in mac.txt. It is
#	an alternative to '^[A-Z]+\.$'
