#! /bin/bash

# ----------------------------------------
# This script adds a participation point
# to a given team.
# 1.- Take a look at the bash script
#     try to put in words its functionality.
# R1.-	The script takes a list of "teams" and pairs
#	them with participation points in the class.
# 2.- Replace this code with a loop in plain bash.
# R2.-	Done in class.
# 3.- Which implementation is more convenient.
# R3.-	We like more the loop one, because it
#	sinegrgyces better going over the teams.
